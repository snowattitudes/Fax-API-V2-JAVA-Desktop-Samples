For your Info,

Nagoya, capital of Japan’s Aichi Prefecture, is a modern manufacturing and shipping hub in central Honshu. The city’s Naka ward is home to museums, pachinko (gambling machine) parlors and the Sakae entertainment district, filled with shops and attractions such as the 42m-tall Sky-Boat Ferris wheel. In northern Naka is Nagoya Castle, a partly reconstructed 1612 royal residence displaying Edo Period artifacts
